# How To Use

This is a morse code keyboard. You use it to type morse code!

There are three input modes:

1. Morse Keyboard
This is the default mode. As you key in valid morse code letters, the device will type the corresponding characters as if you'd typed them yourself on a normal keyboard. 
For example, if you key in "...", then "---", then "...", your computer will act as if you just typed the letters "SOS".

2. Dots and Dashes
Every time you key in a short press (a "dot") or a long press (a "dash"), the device will type a "." or "-" character. 
This is useful if you want to send messages in morse code to your friends!

3. Space Bar
In this mode, the telegraph key just acts like a space bar. You can think of it like a one-button keyboard.
This mode is mostly useful if you're a developer who wants to build a custom experience using the hardware,
as it's the only mode that triggers discrete keydown and keyup events.
